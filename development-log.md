Status update 1 - 15/07/21: I have organised my general control flow diagram on paper and will create a control flow diagram on draw.io. I have written down on google docs the planning stage including the purpose and scope, knowing what features and functions to add and will be adding the documentation to my trello board. Today I will be working on the bulk of my code. Essentially I have decided to create a quiz game with three levels. I am coding a python file that contains test_questions, level_1_questions, level_2_questions and leve_3_questions. I need to code a while loop that will take into consideration how many points the player has so far to load the correct level of questions.

Status update 2 - 16/07/21: I have prepared a bash script to execute my application which appears to be working. A help.md file has also been created and updated. I have finished all of my applications featurese and functions except for the leaderboard. Still getting errors.  Have moved on from there for now and focusing on finishing my README.md, development-log.md and touching on my question.py dictionary. After focusing and finishing on these tasks I will ask Jeremy or Oliver to assist with my leaderboard issue, and hopefully have the final product ready to submit, after testing.
